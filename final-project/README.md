##Semantic Re-Strucutre
A visual essay which argues for creating a standard of semantic markdown structure in academic paper style formats. Standard formats used in highschool and higher education like MLA, APA, Chicago, etc. have not embraced semantic structure despite nearly all academic papers being written on modern word processors which support such structures. This essay would use css styling, animation, etc. to demonstrate the importance of changing our academic writing style standards.
