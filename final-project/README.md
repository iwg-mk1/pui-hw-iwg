# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![mural budgeter sketch](images/sketch1.png)



A tool for figuring out how much paint to buy when painting a mural. It is interactive because users will upload images and input dimensions and paint colors. To make the design accessible I will use a color naming library to help colorblind users make sure they're picking the colors they want.

### *Idea 2*

![riso-fy sketch](images/sketch2.png)

A tool which exports color channels from an image for risograph printing and creates a simulation of what the image would look like when printed on a risograph. This can be used both for those printing on risographs, or for those who do not access to them to mimic the effect. It is interactive because the user uploads images and selects parameters. To make the design accessible I will use a color naming library to help colorblind users make sure they're picking the colors they want.

### *Idea 3*

![semantic re-structure sketch](images/sketch3.png)

A visual essay which directly argues, as well as demonstates, the need for incorperating semantic structure into academic paper style formats. It will be interactive because as the user scrolls, the essay will transform. It will be accessible by being as well structured as it argues academic paper formats ought to be.

## Feedback Summary


The ideas were well received with emphasis on pursuing the mural budgeter idea and making it work for normal home improvement purposes as well. The method of inputing dimensions was discussed, with the idea that technologies like AR could be explored for this application. One of my group members is also a School of Art student and agreed that formatting for risograph is, as it stands, quite tedious. This feedback is helpful because it is direct from the target audience. One concern that was brought up for the project however is there might be significant difficulty in simulating the effect of the risograph, especially given the complexities of subtractive color mixing. Essentially I would be creating my own riso library and making an interactive UI for it. The essay idea did not get as much attention, however a callback to the WCAG guidelines for written text was helpful.

## Feedback Digestion


Even though the general consensus was towards the mural budgeter idea, I am still excited about the others. The risograph project poses the greatest engineering challenge, while the essay might be able to make the most impact. However since the risograph project would require me to create a library which calculates color transformations that would closest mimic a risograph, the engineering requirements of the project might take away too much of my focus from the design of the project. I was exicted by the discussion of using AR to enter dimensions for the mural budgeter, so I will explore some AR and computer vision libraries and judge their viability for this project. Using these libraries might allow greater functionality for home improvement purposes since measuring irregular walls can be difficult using just a tape measure.
